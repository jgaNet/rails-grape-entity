# Todo API

This is an example application showing how to use
[grape](https://github.com/intridea/grape) to create a simple API using
entities with the [grape-entity](https://github.com/intridea/grape-entity) gem.
This sample shows how to create a simple API without authentication, caching, etc.
It also only shows GET requests.  It doesn't update or delete any information.  I
plan to add a few examples, but this is really just to show how Grape + Grape-Entity
work together.

## Environment

The sample was developed using the following 

1. Rails 4.1.4
2. ruby 2.1.0p0
3. OS X 10.9.4
4. Grape (0.8.0) 
5. Grape Entity (0.4.3) 

## Setup

```

## Testing
